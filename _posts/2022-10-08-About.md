I am a Research Associate at the Alan Turing Institute supervised by [Gesine Reinert]([https://duckduckgo.com](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~reinert/)) and Mihai Cucuringu from the University of Oxford.

Previously I was a Research Assistant in Statistical Cyber-Security at Imperial College London supervised by Nick Heard.

I did my PhD in Statistics at Lancaster University supervised by Simon Lunagomez and Robin Mitra.
