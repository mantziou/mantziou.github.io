My main research focus is the statistical analysis of network data. Networks emerge in various scientific fields such as Sociology, Biology, Neuroscience to name a few. Even though research on networks has been ongoing for several years, there is still a great need for the development of methods to better understand and analyse networks in order to get insights from their structure under different settings.
